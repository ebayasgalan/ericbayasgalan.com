      <p>
        I am a software engineer living and working in the Bay Area. I am
        dedicated to my work and passionate about making websites. I believe
        writing efficient, scalable and maintainable code is essential to
        programming. Every project or a problem is a chance for me to improve my
        knowledge and better myself as a developer and co-worker. I see myself
        as a flexible developer, able to work with any team and understand the
        goal of each project. I am currently seeking a full time position in
        software engineering or web development.
