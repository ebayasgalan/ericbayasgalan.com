  //         We live in a world where we need to move quickly and iterate on our
  //         ideas as flexibly as possible. Building mockups strikes the ideal
  //         balance between true-life representation of the end product and ease
  //         of modification.
  //       </p>

  //       <p>
  //         Mockups are useful both for the creative phase of the project - for
  //         instance when you&lsquo;re trying to figure out your user flows or the
  //         proper visual hierarchy - and the production phase when they will
  //         represent the target product. Making mockups a part of your creative
  //         and development process allows you to quickly and easily ideate.
